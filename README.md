# Data Science project - Analysis of physiological data among smokers and non-smokers:
As we know, cigarette smoking is a common phenomenon in our society.
Smoking is defined as a medical problem due to its potential to cause many diseases, such as: heart disease, cancer and the like.
In this project, my goal is to build the contract model whether people smoke or not according to their physiological data.

My research question: 
Is it possible, based on physiological data, 
to conclude whether a person smokes or does not smoke and which physiological data is the most important in order to identify whether a person smokes or does not smoke?

This project was mainly about preprocessing the data and understanding how to deal with unclean and unbalanced data.
Later I performed a classification by different models and checked which model provides the best accuracy.
